Fitness Tracker allows users to keep track of the exercises done. The application was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.2. 
The database used in the application is Google Firebase and the state management tool implemented in the project is NgRx. The designing is heavily inspired from Angular Material.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
